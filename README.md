Classification_MLP_CNN_LSTM.ipynb
#MLP
#1D CNN
#1D-CNN_LSTM
MLP, 1D CNN and LSTM are used just to show how they can be employed to a classification task.
In this case they are not the best performers possibly because of small data size and no time series information in it ( which is required for LSTM)
